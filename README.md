#Installation
This README assumes you have docker & docker-compose installed. For installation instructions see 
<https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>.

If you wish to run GUI programs you must have a X server running on your host machine;

For instructions on setting up the host server on Windows see <https://dev.to/darksmile92/run-gui-app-in-linux-docker-container-on-windows-host-4kde>.

For linux instructions see <https://askubuntu.com/questions/213678/how-to-install-x11-xorg#answer-213685>.

#Configuration
Create a populated env file named __awsvariables.env__ at the directory root with the following variables;  

**AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=FOO  
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=BAR  
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1**

If you'd prefer not to use the env file you can always set variables inside the container which is helpful if the values aren't known ahead of time or you don't want to restart the container;  

**export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=FOO  
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=BAR  
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=REGION**

If you wish to run GUI programs you must set a **DISPLAY** variable with the host ip corresponding to the desired host server. This can be set in the docker-compose file or exported like the previous example.


#Usage
Here's a command to bootup the container & attach to the terminal;  
`docker-compose run --rm kaliterminal`

If you'd prefer for the container to run in the background unattached you can stand it up like this for later attachment;   
`docker-compose up -d`


Once attached to the container you can quickly verify your credentials with the following aws command which executes regardless of IAM permissions;  
`aws sts get-caller-identity`


Run lambdaguard to generate a report for the configured aws account storing the output files in /lambdaguard\_output;  
`lambdaguard --keys ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}`

There are a couple of bash aliases for applications that were installed outside of the package manager, namely `burpsuite` & `firefox`.  
Those will launch the corresponding application in a new process without blocking the terminal but can only be rendered one at time.  

For a quick installation survey you checkout the dockerfile _dep\_install_ stage.  
Braver souls can run the following to see everything installed on the image;  
`apt list --installed`
